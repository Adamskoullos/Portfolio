# Welcome to my portfolio

**[Live link](https://adamskoullos.com/)**

Built using the Vue cli, Vue-router and Vue 3 and the composition api. I am using the Marked markdown previewer for the blog and Firebase Firestore, Storage and Authentication.

The site navigation includes custom built components with custom design and built responsive behaviour.

The focus for skill development during the build process included:

- Introduction of SASS and integrating SASS with Vue
- Refinement of use of: Box-shadows, transitions and transforms
- Increasing consistency with positioning using rows and columns in conjunction with Flexbox within columns
- Working with the composition api, components, composables and third party api's
- Introducing the use of a markdown previewer
- Use of Bootstrap 5 cards
- building on GSAP familiarity with the use of sequenced animations, in conjunctions with Vue transitions and JavaScript hooks
